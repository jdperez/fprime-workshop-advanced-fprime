# Hardware List

If you are following the **Advanced F´ Workshop** remotely, you’ll need to supply your own hardware. The in-person workshop provides these items, but remote attendees should gather the following before starting:

* **Raspberry Pi 5**
  Used as the development and runtime platform for F´ deployments.
  Raspberry PIs may be sourced via [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/raspberry-pi/SC1431/21658261) and other vendors.

* **LED** (standard 3.3V or 5V, with appropriate resistor)
  Supports the **base LED Blinker workshop** exercises and is extended in this advanced workshop.

* **MPU-6050 Accelerometer and Gyroscope**
  The class uses the [Adafruit MPU-6050](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3886) breakout.

* **XBee 3 Radio Module**
  Must be configured with **firmware for point-to-point mode** before use. Refer to the [XBee Radio Setup](docs/xbee-radio-setup.md) guide for configuration instructions.
  XBee 3 is available through [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/digi/XB3-24Z8PT/8130937) and other vendors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure you have the necessary cables and adapters to connect power and data for each device.

> [!TIP]
> These are the components used in the official workshop. Equivalent hardware may also work, but you may need to adjust wiring, drivers, or F´ component code.
